		<h2>What is Ansible?</h2>
		<p>Ansible is an open-source automation tool, or platform, used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, intraservice orchestration, and provisioning. Automation is crucial these days, with IT environments that are too complex and often need to scale too quickly for system administrators and developers to keep up if they had to do everything manually. Automation simplifies complex tasks, not just making developers jobs more manageable but allowing them to focus attention on other tasks that add value to an organization. In other words, it frees up time and increases efficiency. And Ansible, as noted above, is rapidly rising to the top in the world of automation tools. Lets look at some of the reasons for Ansibles popularity.</p>

		<h2>Ansibles Features and Capabilities</h2>
		<p>
		<b>1. Configuration Management</b>

		Ansible is designed to be very simple, reliable, and consistent for configuration management. If youre already in IT, you can get up and running with it very quickly. Ansible configurations are simple data descriptions of infrastructure and are both readable by humans and parsable by machines.<br> 
		<b>2. Application Deployment</b>

		Ansible lets you quickly and easily deploy multitier apps. You wont need to write custom code to automate your systems; you list the tasks required to be done by writing a playbook, and Ansible will figure out how to get your systems to the state you want them to be in. In other words, you wont have to configure the applications on every machine manually. When you run a playbook from your control machine, Ansible uses SSH to communicate with the remote hosts and run all the commands (tasks).<br>
		<b>3. Orchestration</b>

		As the name suggests, orchestration involves bringing different elements into a beautifully run whole operationsimilar to the way a musical conductor brings the notes produced by all the different instruments into a cohesive artistic work. For example, with application deployment, you need to manage not just the front-end and backend services but the databases, networks, storage, and so on. You also need to make sure that all the tasks are handled in the proper order. Ansible uses automated workflows, provisioning, and more to make orchestrating tasks easy.<br> 
		<b>	4. Security and Compliance</b>

		As with application deployment, sitewide security policies (such as firewall rules or locking down users) can be implemented along with other automated processes. If you configure the security details on the control machine and run the associated playbook, all the remote hosts will automatically be updated with those details. That means you wont need to monitor each machine for security compliance continually manually. And for extra security, an admins user ID and password arent retrievable in plain text on Ansible.<br>
		<b>	5. Cloud Provisioning</b>
		The first step in automating your applications life cycle is automating the provisioning of your infrastructure. With Ansible, you can provision cloud platforms, virtualized hosts, network devices, and bare-metal servers.</p>

		<h2>Ansible Architecture</h2>
		<p>
	       <b>	1. Modules</b>

	       Modules are like small programs that Ansible pushes out from a control machine to all the nodes or remote hosts. The modules are executed using playbooks (see below), and they control things such as services, packages, and files. Ansible executes all the modules for installing updates or whatever the required task is, and then removes them when finished. Ansible provides more than 450 modules for everyday tasks.<br>
		<b>	2. Plugins</b>

		As you probably already know from many other tools and platforms, plugins are extra pieces of code that augment functionality. Ansible comes with a number of its plugins, but you can write your own as well. Action, cache, and callback plugins are three examples.<br>
	       <b>	3. Inventories</b>

	       All the machines youre using with Ansible (the control machine plus nodes) are listed in a single simple file, along with their IP addresses, databases, servers, and so on. Once you register the inventory, you can assign variables to any of the hosts using a simple text file. You can also pull inventory from sources like EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud).<br>
		<b>	4. Playbooks</b>

		Ansible playbooks are like instruction manuals for tasks. They are simple files written in YAML, which stands for YAML Aint Markup Language, a human-readable data serialization language. Playbooks are really at the heart of what makes Ansible so popular is because they describe the tasks to be done quickly and without the need for the user to know or remember any particular syntax. Not only can they declare configurations, but they can orchestrate the steps of any manually ordered task, and can execute tasks at the same time or at different times.Each playbook is composed of one or multiple plays, and the goal of a play is to map a group of hosts to well-defined roles, represented by tasks.<br>
		<b>	5. APIs</b>

		Various APIs (application programming interfaces) are available so you can extend Ansibles connection types (meaning more than just SSH for transport), callbacks, and </p>
